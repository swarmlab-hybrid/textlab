Key map features

I try to avoid C- combinations for the things I do frequently, mapping things that make sense to the key.

The leader key provides a facility for creating customized shortcuts that can be further restricted to apply only in certain modes, such as normal, insert, visual, terminal (neovim-specific), etc.

The leader key is normally defined by the mapleader variable as .
